## Install Requirements
```bash
conda create -n colmnew python=3.10
conda activate colmnew
conda install -c nvidia cuda-python
pip install -r requirement.txt --no-cache-dir --no-build-isolation
git clone https://github.com/hsgser/vllm.git
cd vllm
VLLM_INSTALL_PUNICA_KERNELS=1 pip install -e .
cd ..
pip install traker[fast] --no-cache-dir
pip install flash-attn==2.5.7 --no-build-isolation
pip install -i https://pypi.org/simple/ bitsandbytes
git clone https://github.com/decile-team/submodlib.git
cd submodlib
pip install -e .
cd ..
pip install -e .
```

Note: Our implementation is tied to `transformers==4.43.2`. If you’re using a different `transformers` version or different model architectures, you may need to upgrade the libraries and modify the following files accordingly:
- colm/custom_phi.py
- colm/subset_trainer_distributed.py
- colm/train.py

## Data Preparation
Please download MathInstruct and SuperGLUE datasets with additional annotations[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kpYMJ0xrn0eLyv-uwhUZCTjFWT6Zlb-Q/view?usp=sharing) and store it under the following path `/data/*.jsonl`.

## Training
```bash
bash scripts/run_math_efficient.sh
```

Note: We implement CoLM with an efficient last-layer zeroth-order gradient estimation that requires approximately only one forward pass of the model. While the selection time is negligible (<0.1s), CoLM still introduces additional overhead, such as synchronizing gradients before selection, broadcasting selected indices back, padding after selection (which can make some samples longer), transferring tensors between CPU and GPU, context switching, and so on. In the paper, we report the ideal training time of our method which is the forward pass time for a batch size of 128 + the forward and backward pass time for a batch size of 64.

## Evaluation
```bash
cd math_eval
bash eval_finetuned.sh /path/to/your/model
```
